# Sound Files (Optional)

## Note:
This application uses the **Web Audio API** to generate sounds programmatically.
No audio files are required!

Sounds are generated in real-time by the `useSound` hook using:
- OscillatorNode for tone generation
- GainNode for volume control
- Different waveforms for each sound type

If you prefer to use pre-recorded sounds, you can place .mp3, .wav, or .ogg files here.
