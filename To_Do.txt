Quiz App 
Roadmap summary: browser quiz with question cards, immediate feedback, score summary and optional timer. 
Frontend-first MVP (keep backend minimal):
Single-page React app (or Vue). Store quizzes as JSON locally (or allow saving to Mongo later).
Core views: Landing → Quiz Card flow → Results + Review.
State: question index, selected answer, timer (optional), score, progress.
UX/UI polish (grade-winners):
Animated card transitions (Framer Motion).
Immediate color-coded feedback with a short explanation and subtle sound/haptic cue.
Microcopy: encouraging messages, contextual tooltips, error states.
Accessibility: keyboard nav, ARIA live regions announcing correct/wrong, high contrast mode.
Gamification: streaks, streak progress bar, confetti animation on milestones.
Onboarding: quick “how to play” overlay with progressive disclosure.
Stretch/front-end heavy features:
Quiz creator UI (drag & drop questions, reorder, preview).
Animated leaderboard & social share cards (generate image of results via canvas).
Theming: animated light/dark with custom color palettes.
Adaptive difficulty (client-side algorithm that adjusts question difficulty).
Local analytics dashboard (charts of performance over time) — localStorage + Chart.js.
Minimal backend use (Node + Mongo):
Optional user auth + save results for leaderboard.
Host quiz JSONs and user profiles — keep routes simple (CRUD only).

Responsive Design
Mobile-First Approach
Base styles for 320px+ screens
Progressive enhancement for larger screens
Breakpoints
Mobile (320-767px) - Single column, stacked cards, hamburger menu
Tablet (768-1023px) - Two-column grid, collapsible sidebar
Desktop (1024px+) - Three-column layout, persistent sidebar, hover effects
CSS Techniques
Flexbox - Button groups, navigation, card layouts
CSS Grid - Dashboard layout, quiz card grid, analytics sections
Custom Properties - Theme switching (light/dark mode)
Media Queries - Responsive breakpoints using min-width
Animations - Smooth transitions on cards, buttons, progress bars

User Journey
First-Time User
Lands on homepage → clicks "Get Started"
Registers with email/password → form validates in real-time
